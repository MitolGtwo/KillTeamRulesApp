Tech-Priests dictate protocols for the Hunter Clade to

    <string name="doctrina_imperatives_description"><![CDATA[
At the end of the Select Operatives step, select
one **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** to be a Primary
Mode for your kill team until the end of the
battle (note that selecting a Primary Mode
doesnt automatically give you the effects of that

still select it as a **STRATEGIC GAMBIT**, as below).\n
\n
**STRATEGIC GAMBIT.** Select one **DOCTRINA
IMPERATIVE** for friendly **HUNTER CLADE**
operatives to have until the Ready step of the next
Strategy phase. Each **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE**
has both an Optimisation and a Deprecation rule.

**DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE**. Once per battle, when
you select the **DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** thats
your kill teams Primary Mode, you can ignore its
Deprecation rule.\n

    <string name="rad_bombardment_lore"><![CDATA[
With a short binharic transmission, the Hunter Clade
call down a radioactive bombardment. Mortar rounds
rain down, emitting swathes of irradiating energy that
flush the enemy from cover or force them to retreat from
critical objectives.
]]></string>

    <string name="rad_bombardment_description"><![CDATA[
Once per battle **STRATEGIC GAMBIT** in any
turning point after the first. Select one objective
marker or your opponents drop zone. Roll one
D6 separately for each enemy operative within
control range of that selected objective marker or
within that drop zone, and subtract 1 if any part
of that enemy operatives base is underneath
Vantage terrain: on a 4+, subtract 1 from that
operatives APL stat until the end of its next
activation; on a 6, also inflict D3 damage on it
(roll separately for each).
]]></string>

    <string name="redundacy_systems_lore"><![CDATA[
Expected to operate behind enemy lines for extended
periods, Hunter Clade operatives are often upgraded
with redundancy augmetics such as backup lungs
and emergency blood packs, ensuring that they
remain capable of functioning even after suffering
terrible damage.
]]></string>

    <string name="redundacy_systems_description"><![CDATA[
Once per turning point, when a friendly **HUNTER
CLADE** operative is activated, if its not within
control range of enemy operatives, you can use
this rule. If you do, that friendly operative regains
up to D3+2 lost wounds.
]]></string>

    <string name="refractor_field_lore"><![CDATA[
A miniaturised shield generator given to key warriors of
the Adeptus Mechanicus, this device projects a barrier

    <string name="refractor_field_description"><![CDATA[
Once per turning point, when an operative is
shooting a friendly **HUNTER CLADE** operative,
at the start of the Roll Defence Dice step, you
can use this rule. If you do, worsen the x of the
Piercing weapon rule by 1 (if any) until the end
of that sequence. Note that Piercing 1 would
therefore be ignored.
]]></string>

    <string name="extremis_mindlink_lore"><![CDATA[
This technology allows Hunter Clade leaders to retain
close control over their Skitarii and Sicarian soldiers. In
turn, the soldiery see the mind-link as a blessed thing,
for the edicts transmitted to them are surely the will of
the Omnissiah.
]]></string>

    <string name="extremis_mindlink_description"><![CDATA[
Once per battle, you can use the Control Edict
firefight ploy for 0CP, but instead of activating

Whenever an enemy operative is shooting against, fighting against or retaliating against a
friendly **HUNTER CLADE VANGUARD** operative,
if that enemy operative is under the effects of the
Rad-Saturation rule (see VANGUARD operatives),
subtract 1 from the Normal Dmg stat of its
weapons (to a minimum of 3).

Whenever an enemy operative within 6\" of a friendly **HUNTER CLADE INFILTRATOR** operative

cannot re-roll their attack dice.

    <string name="scouting_protocol_description"><![CDATA[
Each friendly **HUNTER CLADE RANGER** operative that has a **Conceal** order and is more
than 6\" from enemy operatives can immediately perform a free **Dash** action in an order of your
choice. You cannot use this ploy during the first turning point.

    <string name="accelerant_agents_lore"><![CDATA[
Sicarian Ruststalkers are flooded with aggression-inducing binharic code, inciting within them a lust for

During each friendly **HUNTER CLADE RUSTSTALKER** operatives activation, it can

    <!--Firefight ploys-->
    <string name="control_edict_lore"><![CDATA[
The leader of a Hunter Clade assumes partial control
of another member of their kill team, coordinating
precision strikes with the nearby operative.
]]></string>

    <string name="control_edict_description"><![CDATA[
Use this firefight ploy when its your turn to
activate a friendly operative. Select one friendly
**HUNTER CLADE LEADER** operative and one
other ready friendly **HUNTER CLADE* operative
visible to and within 3\" of that **LEADER* operative;
activate one of them as normal. When that first
friendly operative you activate is expended,
you can activate the other friendly operative
before your opponent activates. When that
other operative is expended, your opponent
then activates as normal. Whenever you use
this ploy, you cannot select more than one
**HUNTER CLADE SICARIAN** operative
]]></string>

    <string name="scrapcode_overload_lore"><![CDATA[
The Hunter Clades Infiltrator releases an enormous
bombardment of static and scrapcode that disrupts
communication channels, reduces enemy coordination
and allows the kill team to seize objectives and materiel
from under their foes nose.
]]></string>

    <string name="scrapcode_overload_description"><![CDATA[
Use this firefight ploy when a friendly **HUNTER
CLADE INFILTRATOR** operative is activated.
Alternatively, use this firefight ploy when
a friendly **HUNTER CLADE INFILTRATOR**
operative, or an enemy operative within 3\" of that
friendly operative, would perform the **Pick Up
Marker** or a mission action (excluding Operate
Hatch). Until the start of that friendly operatives
next activation, whenever determining control
of a marker, treat the total APL stat of enemy
operatives that contest it as 1 lower if at least
one of those enemy operatives is within 3\" of
that friendly operative. Note this isnt a change
to the APL stat, so any changes are cumulative
with this, and this can change control of a marker
before performing the action.

    <string name="command_override_lore"><![CDATA[
By activating command overrides, the imperatives of
individual operatives can be altered in response to evershifting mission parameters.

    <string name="command_override_description"><![CDATA[
Use this firefight ploy when you activate a friendly
**HUNTER CLADE** operative. Select a **DOCTRINA

The most extreme form of doctrina imperative, this
protocol pushes an operatives wiring beyond safe
limits, providing additional combat power at the cost of
burned circuitry and charred flesh.
]]></string>

    <string name="omnssiah_imperative_description"><![CDATA[
Use this firefight ploy during a friendly **HUNTER
CLADE** operatives activation. Alternatively, use
it when an enemy operative is shooting a friendly
**HUNTER CLADE** operative, at the end of the
Roll Attack Dice step. Until the Ready step of
the next Strategy phase, that friendly operative
has an additional rule determined by its current
**DOCTRINA IMPERATIVE** as follows:\n
\n
• Protector: This operatives ranged weapons have the Severe weapon rule.\n
• Conqueror: Whenever this operative is fighting, after resolving your first attack dice during
that sequence, you can immediately resolve another (before your opponent).\n
• Bulwark: Improve this operatives Save stat by 1. In addition, whenever an operative is
shooting this operative, you can collect and roll one additional defence dice. If you use this
ploy during a **Shoot** action, this operatives Save stat is changed immediately (this takes
precedence over the core rules).\n
• Aggressor: You can ignore the first vertical distance of 2\" this operative moves during one climb up.\n
• Neutral: None\n
\n
Note that you can use this ploy after rolling attack or defence dice for this operative, or before or
after retaining or re-rolling those dice.
