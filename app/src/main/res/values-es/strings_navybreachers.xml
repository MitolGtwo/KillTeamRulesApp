Whenever you would use the Attack Order or Defence Order strategy ploy, if this operative is in the killzone, it
costs you 0CP. Once during each of this operatives activations, before or after it performs an action, if your Attack Order or Defence
Order marker is in the killzone (see relevant strategy ploy), you can either:\n
• Remove that marker and place it again.\n
• Change the selected ploy to the other (e.g. your Attack Order becomes a Defence Order).\n
You cannot do both, and you don’t need to spend any CP to change the ploy
