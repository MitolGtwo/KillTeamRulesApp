The first time during each turning point that another friendly **NOVITIATE** operative would be incapacitated while visible

operative. If you do, that friendly operative is not incapacitated, has 1 wound remaining and cannot be incapacitated for the remainder
of the action. After that action, that friendly operative can immediately perform a free **Dash** action, but must end that move within
this operatives control range. Subtract 1 from this and that operatives APL stats until the end of their next activations respectively,
and if this rule was used during that friendly operatives activation, that activation ends. You cannot use this rule if this operative is
incapacitated, or if it is a **Shoot** action and this operative would be a primary or secondary target.
